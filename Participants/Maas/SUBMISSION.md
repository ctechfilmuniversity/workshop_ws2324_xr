The idea was to recreate Caspar David Friedrich's famous painting "The Wanderer above the Sea of Fog" in VR and bring it to life!

To do this, I used AI to cut out and extend image elements from the original painting so that I could incorporate them into the game. Using a mix of sprites and 3D models, the landscape was recreated to be as close as possible to the original. 

For the interaction, I wanted to add something more stunning. Since the player takes the position of the hiker, I thought about what the hiker in the picture is thinking, what is typical when you stand high up in the mountains and look into the distance - and that's how I came up with the idea of yodeling! The player can experience his own voice as it echoes from the distant mountains. A nice little gimmick that should be fun ðŸ™‚

For the sound design I built a natural soundscape, which after a while is complemented by Tchaikovsky's Waltz of the Flowers to capture the dreamy atmosphere of the picture.
