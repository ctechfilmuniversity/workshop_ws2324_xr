# Virtual Gallery - IN NUDO VERITAS

<br>


### Description

For this workshop, I wanted to create an art gallery VR Experience. 

I've worked with a model provided by Unity following one of their [tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/lesson-2-create-a-personal-3d-gallery-project-with-unity-copy?uv=2019.4&projectId=5f56a49aedbc2a002102b292#) on how to build a 3D Gallery. 

As for the content, I've used a project that I developed during my Bachelor at Scuola Civica di Cinema Luchino Visconti. I've translated everything so that you can read through it if you'd like to learn more about the project. The original idea was to provide the user with an audioguide, which I think would suit better with the project. In the end I didn't have enough time to re-do the audio and I've also encountered some technical issues and I've decided to put a description.

[Here](Ferro_presentation.pdf) you can find a pdf with the concept of the exhibition and the descriptions of the compositions.
