### *General* 

So my idea was to spatialize sounds by Particle Movements in 3D. In this course i wanted to create a VR scene that uses the headtracking of the glasses for having an immersive sound experience. The visualization of the particles in VR was the seconds aspect of my approach. I chose TouchDesigner as my environment for development. As a VR Device i took the HTC Vive Pro, which uses the SteamVR SDK (OpenVR).

### *Showcase Video* 

In the following video the usecase of this project is shown. Make sure to listen with headphones. (its binaural stereo audio for giving the best impression of the 3D Spatialization possible)

### *Patch Explanation Video*

As i can't build TouchDesigner Patches as .exe , therefore i'll provide the complete project files under "../main/td", aswell as the following video.

(the particle system isn't explained as my work for the XR Course doesn't include any editings or advancements on that particular part)
