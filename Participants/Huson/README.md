# Aletschgletscher VR Prototype 

This VR prototype encompasses a few ideas of a larger project which seeks to combine geological and real-time weather data of the Aletschgletscher with mythology. The glacier mesh is created using a DEM (digital elevation model) from swisstopo (swisstopo.admin.ch) of a small part of the Aletschglacier. 

My goal was to create a rudimentary digital twin, using real-time data from OpenWeatherMap. Depending on the time of day and on the cloudiness, different skyboxes are used at runtime. Wind speed values correlate with the volume of the wind audio, cloudiness values are connected with a cloud particle system. Going forward, I will refine and expand the use (and interaction with) real-time data, complete the glacier model and integrate the mythological storytelling component.
