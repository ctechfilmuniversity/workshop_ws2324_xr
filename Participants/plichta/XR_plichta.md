**Submission of work**

1. A Readme file with a short paragraph (i.e. a few sentences) about your project and the idea behind it
My idea was to create a virtual directional microfone in AR. The user can look at a small monochrome village and find sounds in the landscape, like bird singing or crickets. The user can increase the size of the mic to hear more sounds at the same time at a lower volume or make the mic tiny but hear everything it points at loud and clearly. 

2. A build (for most of you a .apk or .exe file)
This is a ziped XCode project since building an ipa would require me to have the phone's UDID.

3. A short video runthrough of the experience, demoing the main content and/or interactions
