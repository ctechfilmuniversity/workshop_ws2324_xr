**ESCAPISM - VR Experience**

My VR scene is based on the concept of my animation prototyp which I created for my Bachelor thesis nearly a year ago.

The aim of my bachelor thesis "Escapims - Reality Escape" was to address the feeling of distancing oneself from reality with all its problems into a kind of illusory reality with the help of modern technology. As a great overall metaphor for this feeling, I used the concept of an underwater world, which is the most natural "illusory reality" for us humans.

I used fish as an abstract stylistic medium to represent the various possibilities of escaping reality. For example a fish that is fused with a smartphone. The more fantastic "less corrupted" fish should represent positiv aspects of escaping reality.


For the XR task I created a mixed up scene where the fish models that I created originally for my animation are rotating around a portal in an underwater space. This "maelstrom" should a hypnotic effect on the audience.

For this scene, I chose a kind of "noir style" in which the bad fish have a very dark colour, while the good fish glow white.

**About the workflow:**

This is the first time I've created something in Unity and it's also my very first VR project. Even if it's only a prototyp, I'm kinda happy with the outcome. 

The only real problem I had was to import the original animations that I created for the fish. Apparently the import didn't work because i didn't created an armature for the meshes, but animated them using shape keys and modifier in Blender. Somehow it is apparently still possible to import the animation in one way or another, but unfortunately I couldn't get it to work.

But because of that I had to improvise and had to learn how to use the empty, game controller and animator controll functions to create an improvised version of my fish animation, which also leveled up my knowledge in Unity. Due to time constrains I was not able polish the scene even more. But I definitely have to practice more in Unity in future.

(small disclaimer: I created all the models in the scence, except the small low ploy stones on the sea floor :D)
