# Extended Realities

**Syllabus**

In this course we will begin to look into XR technologies and the real-time engines that underpin them. Students will gain an overview of these technologies, their history and use in the creative disciplines. We will consider in detail some design criteria for VR and AR, as well as appropriate technologies and workflows, through looking at and critique of case studies from the fields of art, games, immersive experiences and apps. On the technical side, students will gain hands-on experience with a game engine (Unity) and be asked to create a VR or AR prototype in response to a given theme/topic.

**Learning Objectives**

- Gain an understanding of the cultural, historical, and political context for the development of real-time technologies, particularly in the area of XR
- Understand how real-time engines are structured and how they interface with other hardware and software
- Understand and be able to implement a basic architecture for real-time experiences in either Unity or Unreal, particularly in the area of XR
- Be able to recognise design criteria specific to XR and develop your own specific to an experience you may want to build
- Design and develop your own XR prototype experience

**Method of Instruction**

- Lectures/discussion-based activities
- Tech demos
- Personal projects

**Topics**

*Course preparation*: Install game engine and necessary supporting software

***Day 1 (27.10)***

*Introduction to Real Time*

- Overview of real time technologies - where does the notion of “real-time” come from? What are “real-time” media and what is their role in society? What about the history of research in the field?
- Real Time in creative fields - where do real-time technologies fit into the creative media landscape today? How are artists/film-makers etc. dealing with this topic? How does real-time differ from more “traditional” pre-rendered media? What does this mean for the role of the creator?
- What are the technologies available to us to create real-time experiences? How do these compare to each other bzw. what are their respective applications, advantages, disadvantages etc.?

*Introduction to XR*

- Introduction to XR technologies - where does the notion of XR come from? What are the important stages of its development? What are its main areas of application?
- XR typology - what are the different kinds of XR experiences? How do they differ from one another? What are some important examples of each? What are the main frameworks with which to develop XR experiences?

LUNCH

*Game Engines* - *For beginners with little or no game engine experience*

- Overview of game engine architecture - what are the main components of a game engine? How do they come together?
- Interface tour of Unity and overview of the important components - asset creation and import, setting up a scene, script creation, engine settings, plugins and packaging
- Introduction to further functions - animation, sound, lighting, triggers, optimisation tools

*Homework*: Install necessary software for VR/AR development

***Day 2 (03.11)***

*Game Engines*

- Troubleshooting with VR/AR software installation
- Preparing Unity/Unreal scene for VR/AR development

LUNCH

*Topics in VR/AR*

- Overview of VR/AR design criteria - what are the important criteria to keep in mind when designing for VR? How do design criteria change with audience? How does VR challenge design criteria for other media?
- Outline a technical workflow for the creation of VR experiences

*Homework*: Design/Storyboard/Wireframe VR or AR experience

***Day 3 (10.11)***

*Project Work - Concept and Prototyping* (3 Hours)

- Develop a VR or AR Prototype using Unity Game Engine (prompt will be given). Prototypes must fulfill a number of criteria in terms of content and interactions (to be defined).

*Homework*: Spend 4-6 hours working on the prototype

***Day 4 (01.12)***

*Project Work - Iteration and Finishing* (3 Hours)

- Finish development of prototype, testing with other course participants, ideas for further development and learning

**Evaluation**

Evaluation will be based on the personal projects undertaken in Days 3 + 4 and for homework. These projects must be submitted both as an .apk (Oculus Quest, Android)/.exe (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive)/.ipa (iPhone/iPad) and as video walkthrough/demo.
